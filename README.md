# RMC/Spock

RMC/Spock is the ROSE meta configuration system built on top of Spock package management.

The RMC layer is a few small shell scripts that allow a developer to
specify what features they need in a ROSE build tree, and the Spock
layer is responsible for finding a solution that satisfies the request
and configuring a shell environment to use that solution.
